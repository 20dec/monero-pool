Things to work on:
 - Improve the build system (ignore missing definitions of Monero objects, it's
   just noise)
 - Add protection against invalid share flooding
 - Offload payout processing to a separate thread (maybe not needed, test)
 - Offload RPC requests to a separate thread (maybe not needed, test)
 - Add daemonizing option (for those too lazy to nohup or use tmux)
